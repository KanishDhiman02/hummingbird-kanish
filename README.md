# Hummingbird-AHO: Feature Selection Library 🐦

A specialized Python library implementing **Artificial Hummingbird Optimization (AHO)** for feature selection in machine learning pipelines. This project operationalizes research originally presented at the **ANTIC 2025 Conference (Springer CCIS)**.

##  Overview
The library provides an automated way to reduce feature dimensionality by simulating the foraging and territorial behaviors of hummingbirds. It utilizes a weighted fitness function to balance classification accuracy and feature reduction, ensuring optimal performance for complex datasets.

##  Installation
Clone the repository and install it as a local package:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/KanishDhiman02/hummingbird-kanish.git](https://github.com/KanishDhiman02/hummingbird-kanish.git)
cd hummingbird-kanish
pip install .
